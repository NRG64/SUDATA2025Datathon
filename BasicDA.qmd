```{r average lead times}
df_fe %>%
  summarise(
    avg_delivery_deviation = mean(delivery_time_deviation, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_lead_time = mean(lead_time_days, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_delay_probability = mean(delay_probability, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r RF OT}
df_fe %>%
  summarise(
    avg_high_risk_fraction = mean(high_risk_fraction, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_high_risk_fraction = max(high_risk_fraction, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```
```{r shipping cost efficiency }

df_fe %>%
  summarise(
    avg_shipping_cost_per_unit = mean(shipping_costs / historical_demand, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_shipping_cost_per_unit = max(shipping_costs / historical_demand, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
